This Python script connects to an email server using IMAP protocol and fetches the details of the first 50 emails from the "inbox" of each email account specified in a file named "emails.txt". The email accounts and passwords are read from "emails.txt" file, which should contain one email account per line in the format "email:password".

For each email, the script extracts the sender's email address and the subject of the email. The email address, sender and subject are then written to a file named "email_result.txt" in the format "email sender subject".

Overall, this script can be used to fetch email details from multiple email accounts at once and store them in a file for further analysis. However, it is important to note that the script might not work for email providers that require two-factor authentication or for email accounts that have restricted access to IMAP protocol.
